read.m is used to play the video files.

Before using interpolation methods, video455-458 should be copied into the folder.

videos are 1608*1208*128.

average.m is used to average the video and get a single image.

I usually pick the center 1024 by 1024 area for image interpolation.

To run the interpolation methods, just use the run.m.
